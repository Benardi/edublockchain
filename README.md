# edublockchain
A blockchain for educational purposes (or Eduardo Chain :)

The aim of this project is to create my own blockchain to better understand basic blockchain concepts. 
Here I also want to experiment different consensus approaches, try out the 51% attack, and figure out how to implement a smart contract within a blockchain.

Wanna contribute? Let's have fun together!
