# edublockchain
A blockchain for educational and learning purposes :)

The aim of this project is to create our own blockchain to better understand basic blockchain concepts. 
Here it would be interesting to experiment different consensus approaches, secure transactions, try out the 51% attack, and figure out how to implement a smart contract within a blockchain.

Wanna contribute? Let's have fun together!
